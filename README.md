# Is this the reason why the team member exam is changing?

Should the cyber scheme be in charge of an industry qualification?

Reasons why not:
* The training material here shows that they teach some pretty specific material.
  - there are topics in "The Knowledge" that seem like maybe it is for their multiple choice exam
  - Ive also shared some of the key information from the slides that is suspiciously similar to the types of questions and tasks i had to do when i took the exam
* There have been reports of conflict of interests with their assessors
* Some assessors show favouritism
* There is a lack of effective marking criteria proven by vague candidate feedback forms
* There have been reports that if you get on well with the organisation you can observe your employees taking an exam (This is completely unethical and the NCSC *have* been made aware of these complaints)
